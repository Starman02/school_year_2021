"""
Starting with player 1, each player gets a turn at answering 5 trivia questions.
(There should be a total of 10 questions so each player gets different
questions.) When a question is displayed, 4 possible answers are also displayed.
Only one of the answers is correct, and if the player selects the correct answer,
he or she earns a point.
After answers have been selected for all the questions, the program displays the number of points earned by each player and declares the player with the highest number of points the winner.
To create this program, write a Question class to hold the data for the trivia question. The question class should have attributes for the following data:
A trivia question
Possible answer 1
Possible answer 2
Possible answer 3
Possible answer 4
The number of the correct answer (1, 2, 3, or 4)
The Question class should also have an appropriate __init__ method, accessors, and mutators.
